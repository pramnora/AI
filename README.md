## Introduction

*AI/Artificial Intelligence*, is being used extensively now-a-days.  

For example, just this morning, I was thinking to write some code...to print out a text message.   
What I actually did was simply request:     
- https://www.meta.ai    
...to write the code for me using:  
- Python  
- Python TK  
- change it to being a scrolling message  
...and, so on.     

The answer came back straight way in just merely 'seconds'...;   
all I had to do was just merely use 'copy and paste'...;  
sure enough the code, actually, worked.  
Next, I needed to modifiy the code output  
by selecting which particular message I wanted to be printed out.  

Thus, it's not really necesssary to learn how to write code, anymore; as AI does the job for you...;    
also, in a very highly efficient, quick, simple, and, straight forwards manner;   
whereas, before, I used to have to research for hours long...;    
and, then, practice writing and correcting code...the which process might take me whole entire days long...;   
now-a-days, all this kind of job can be achieved in just merely seconds...all thanks to the sheer beauty of AI.

It's not just in coding, alone, that AI helps...;  
but, it can be used to:  
- produce graphics  
- write poetry  
- write songs  
- write plays  
- write letters  
- etc.  
...write almost anything you could care to 'imagine'.
